## :books: DESCRIPTION :books:

printf() functions are a series of default inbuilt library functions in C programming language which produces output according to a format specified. They are available in C library by default. These functions are declared and defined in stdio.h which is a header file in C language. To make use of the printf() and scanf() functions, we have to include stdio.h in the library functions in C#.
In C# programming language, printf() function used to print the character, string, float, integer, octal and hexadecimal values onto the output screen.
We use printf() function with %d format specifier to display the value of an integer variable.
Similarly %c is used to display character, %f for float variable, %s for string variable, %lf for double and %x for hexadecimal variable.
To generate a newline,we use \n in C printf() statement.
